# Abivia Cogs

Cogs is a suite of interfaces for common objects, primarily used in business and ecommerce (but
not limited to that scope).

Cogs is a work in progress. The interfaces are not complete or stable. There are more 
interfaces yet to be defined.

The intent is to achieve some level of interoperability between applications by having them
conform to these interfaces.

Suggestions, comments, and contributions are welcome.
